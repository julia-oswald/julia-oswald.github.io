    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Julia Oswald, and I am a high school math teacher in Kansas City,
         Missouri. This year I am teaching College Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus. Over the years, 
         I have had the opportunity to teach all of the math classes my high school offers. 
        <br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completed my bachelor and master’s degrees in mathematics from
         <em>Central Methodist University</em>. I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2022 from the Learning
          Technologies and Design program. <br/>I am excited to learn more about coding and to have web 
          development background knowledge to create a website for my class. I have a small background in 
          coding. I learned some Python in a numerical analysis class that I took for my master’s degree. 
          In my free time I enjoy spending time outside and biking. Whenever I have time to travel, I love 
          going to the mountains to hike and fish with my husband.</p>
