    <p><b>Learning Goal 1:</b><br>Students can find and write the standard form and vertex form of a quadratic 
          and identify key parts of the graph. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Quadratic functions have many real life applications which makes them a really fun type of function 
      to study. In this section, we will be analyzing the graph of a function, a parabola, and examining different 
      forms of the quadratic equation. We will first take a look at standard form of a quadratic and identify how 
      to find the key features of the equation such as intercepts, roots, vertex, and the axis of symmetry. We will 
      then take a look at the vertex form of a quadratic and identify the key features. </p>

    <p><b>Learning Goal 2:</b><br>Students can describe and identify features of a polynomial graph and write a polynomial equation.</p>
		<br>
    <p>The lesson starts off with vocabulary necessary for completing problems of polynomials successfully. Some 
      of these vocabulary word degree, coefficient, constant, leading term.  Multiplicity is also introduced and 
      covered in this section. Multiplicity is how a graph behaves at each zero, this is important for graphing 
      polynomials. This section also talks about finding zeros or roots algebraically and writing a polynomial 
      equation given the zeros of the function.</p>

  <h2 id = "FindingRoots"> Finding Roots</h2>
  <p><b>Learning Goal 3:</b><br>Students can find all parts roots/zeros of a polynomial using either long division or 
    synthetic division. Students will also be able to write an equation of a polynomial given itâ€™s roots.</p>
<br>
<p>This lesson will have two instructional videos that go along with it. The first video talks about dividing polynomials. 
  Long division is first introduced followed by synthetic division. It is important to know how to do both methods since 
  you cannot always use synthetic division. The second part of the lesson talks about finding zeros of polynomials after 
  using some sort of division to break the equation into smaller parts. Our first big theorem of college algebra also appears 
  in this second section, the fundamental theorem of algebra. Finally conjugate pairs are introduced when talking about rational 
  and imaginary zeros of polynomials.</p>
 <br>
 <p>Check out the following two videos for this lesson.</p>
