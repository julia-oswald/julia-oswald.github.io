     My name is Julia Oswald and I am a high school math teacher in Kansas City, Missouri. This year I am teaching College Algebra, Precalculus, and Calculus. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to teach all of the math classes my high school offers. I completed my bachelor and master’s degrees in mathematics from Central Methodist University. I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2022 from the Learning Technologies and Design program. I am excited to learn more about coding and to have web development background knowledge to create a website for my class. I have a small background in coding. I learned some Python in a numerical analysis class that I took for my master’s degree. In my free time I enjoy spending time outside and biking. Whenever I have time to travel, I love going to the mountains to hike and fish with my husband.
