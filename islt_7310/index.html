    <h3>Welcome!</h3> I hope this website becomes an excellent study tool while learning college algebra.
    
        <p>The goal of this webpage is to help students learn topics in college algebra with instructional videos, examples, and practice problems. College algebra is a common mathematics class among high school and college students. This website is to be used as a learning and study resource. The contents of this website will dissect polynomials. We will be covering quadratics, polynomials and finding roots of polynomials. There will be instructional videos to help students that are meant to act as mini lectures for students. There will also be PDF copies of notes and practice problems for students to practice. When students have complete working through the videos and practice problems, they will have a general understanding of polynomials, their graphs, and how to find their roots.</p>
